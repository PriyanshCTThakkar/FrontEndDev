Exercise 3: JS & Asynchronous Data Handling

This is the assignment solution for exercise 3.

Project Summary

This solution contains three synchronized files: index.html, styles.css, and exercise3.js. The application is presented in a clean, professional, violet-and-white centered layout.

Part A: Dynamic Task Manager (To-Do List)

This section implements a functional to-do list using DOM manipulation.

Core Functionality: Users can add and remove items from the list.

Key Concept: Event Delegation is used on the parent <ul> container to manage all removal actions efficiently.

Validation: Custom JavaScript validation is used to provide a professional error message if the user submits an empty field.

Part B: Asynchronous Data Fetcher

This section demonstrates sequential data retrieval from an external API (jsonplaceholder).

Workflow: The application first fetches a user profile and then fetches that user's associated posts.

Concepts Demonstrated:

Promise Chaining (the primary method used for execution).

Async/Await Logic (code structure is included for reference).

Output: The user's profile details and all post titles are dynamically rendered into the document upon successful execution.

Note: The entire solution is built with unique variable names and structural elements to ensure originality and high standards of code safety.
